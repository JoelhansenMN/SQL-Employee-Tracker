# PostgreSQL Employee Tracker 

## Description
  For this task we were instructed to create a command-line applicatoin to manage a company's employee database that uses Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL. This database was built from scratch by this developer and includes tables for: departments, roles (which include an id for each role, the name, the salary and title), and information about the employee (which includes an id employee, first and last name, their role id and whether they have a manager).  This application allows users to scroll and selct the option of their choice.  Users are able to view all departments, roles and employee tables and also are provided with the options to add a department, role and employee and finally the option to update a current employee's role.
